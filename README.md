### Setup ###

I built this on Python 3.5. Ideally you would have a virtual environment so you could run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the necessary 3rd party libraries.

This requires the Java app (with Jonathan's endpoint modifications) to be running and serving as a sort of GDS.

To run the app: `python app.py`

To test the app: `python tests.py`
